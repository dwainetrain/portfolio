# Minderva

This project is called Minderva, it's very mindful of language learners needs. If you're learning a language there is much you need. You need pronunciation, you need speaking ability, you need listening and comprehension ability, you need writing and reading ability. Only with all these abilities will you truly master a language and make it your own. I have yet to make one my own because I just move forward learning other things. Why is time and memory and ability so limited. Isn't it better to look at your lot and say there, there is my lot.

```javascript
// Here's some code from that thing
const punk = "Is dead.";

if (longLivePunk === true) {
  return "bang";
}
```

So there you have it. Let's try a link also [Qucik Jump](https://google.com). I wonder how all of this will look once parsed by the system at _GraphCMS_.

## In conclusion

I made it, and now I want to make more things. But less things like my portfolio. **Cheers!**
