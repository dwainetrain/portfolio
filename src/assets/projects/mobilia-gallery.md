#### An Art Gallery with Ecommerce Elements

_A long-time client of mine, Mobilia Gallery needed an update to their website, which was split into two wordpress sites at the time. One was the primary site and the other which was an ecommerce store front. The goal was to combine both into a single functining site without losing the purpose of each._

The Stack:

- Gatsby
- Wordpress with GraphQL
- Woocommerce
- Tailwind CSS
- Storybook

The challenges. The push toward a well formed MVP. What needed to be cut to make the deadline. Interpreting client requests. Making all the tech play well together. Incorporating legacy and modern tools.
