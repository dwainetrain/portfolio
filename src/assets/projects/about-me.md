1. Use guiding questions.
   Consider answering these guiding questions to create content for your blurb:

What am I doing in my professional life and what experiences led me here?
What values do I consider most necessary for my success?
What do I hope to accomplish in the near future?
What are the traits and achievements I most want to be known for?

I'm a Freelance Graphic/Web Designer and Theatre Technician who's making the move to Front-End development. I've always been inquisitive by nature, and love to explore and geek out over technology, programming, art and design. These interests have been the key inspirations and motivations in my professional life.

Unique problems and finding their solutions, and giving those solutions pragmattic polish. Getting lost in details that improve the experience of the user (or viewer), small dedicated teams that thrive on commuinication and researching unxpected avenues.

I’m self-taught as hell. From React to Figma to UX design, I can’t stop adding new tools to my toolbox. One day, I volunteered to help with scenic painting at La Jolla Playhouse. Now my work is on Broadway, and I’m a journeyman Scenic Artist with Iatse local 122. Once I get started, I just can’t stop.

I hope to learn from Senior Developers and peers to quickly get my Front End Development skills honed for a Senior Position.

I've executed projects large and small and am production driven. I'm messy when exploring ideas and obsessively organized when it comes time to put the project in motion.

And I have boundless curiosity, whether exploring legacy systems or cutting edge tech, or even new cooking techniques, I love following ideas and hunches into rabbit holes and then melding everything into a creative solution for the project at hand.

So I think you can build off of your current about me, just give it a little more programming emphasis...

I’ve always been insatiably curious about art. That’s what led me to a degree in museum studies. And that curiosity is what feeds my design. I dig into your project and your world, then communicate your vision in a way that’s both compelling and functional.

I’m self-taught as hell. From photoshop to coding to UX design, I can’t stop adding new tools to my toolbox. One day, I volunteered to help with scenic painting at La Jolla Playhouse. Now my work is on Broadway, and I’m a journeyman Scenic Artist with Iatse local 122. Once I get started, I just can’t stop.

Art is collaborative. So is our project. In my decade-plus doing visual design for Mobilia Gallery, I’ve seen it all. Digital, print, web, email…you name it, I’ve designed it. I’ve worked with hundreds of artists, musicians, and authors to communicate their vision with precision.

Design, always research-backed. Some designers go with their gut—I go farther. I’ll get to know the history of your craft and your personal brand. That research lets me deliver designs that frame your work beautifully.
