## Expiditing my accomplishments and ideas

_I wanted to create a site that quickly showcased the projects I've worked on, articles I've written and ideas I'm formulating_

[Live Site](https://minderva-17770.web.app/) | [Github](https://github.com/dwainetrain/minderva)

The Stack:

- Gatsby
- GraphCMS (trying out alternatives to the CMS like wordpress)
- SASS
- Netlify with Gatsby intergration

Pictures of designs here too.
Mention what's in the works.
